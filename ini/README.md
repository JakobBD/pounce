This directory contains example YAML parameter files.

Files in the demonstrator_XY directories can be run out of the box and are included in the github action regression tests.

The ice directory conatains a complex application case, which needs additional parameter files and adapted codes.

Files in the demonstrator_batch_local directory are commented. 
In addition, the file parameter_mfmc.yml in the ice subdirectory has comments on additional parameters, which are not used in the simple test examples.
