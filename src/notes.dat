- remove sublevels, have models instead and create interfaces (including first / last sample) 
- create external and internal part for every stage
- move common part of config_list to "common" subdict

MFMC: 
- problem: sorting is changed, i.e. current n_samples might not be ascending => ONLY TWO iterations?!
- prescribed MSE: 
   - prescribed comp. budget p 
   - get vanilla MC MSE for p 
   - prescribe this MSE for MFMC also
